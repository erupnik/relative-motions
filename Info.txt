- filter 2-view and 3-view based on residual 
- add noise to poses
- compare with 5-pts on noised poses 

export edges    in: martini pairs                    out: edges

r21 = (R2 * R1^-1)^-1
R1^-1 => -R1^-1*C1,  R1^-1
c = C2 + R2* (-R1^-1*C1)
r = R2*R1^-1 



NOTES
- small bundle:
  * the small rotation is applied through W^T because p = R^t (P-C) AND R^t = (R0 (I + W))^t = (I + W)^t R0^t 
     P =  P0 + W^T ^ P0
- Vector B in propagation set to NULL





==== 2d net in mmv2
+ PropagCov: does propagation of one element to global net, 
  * run from within the big net (SolveByCovPropagation in Exe) but the method is in elementary net (PropagCov)

- create big net and initiatlise
- propagate
- DoOneIter -> this is only to get the reference result
